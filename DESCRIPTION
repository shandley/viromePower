Description: Provides tools for power analysis in virome studies. This package 
    helps researchers determine optimal sample sizes, estimate statistical power,
    and design robust virome studies accounting for high sparsity, low abundance,
    and other unique characteristics of viral metagenomic data. Includes methods
    for standard power analysis, stratified study designs, Bayesian approaches,
    and viral diversity metrics (alpha and beta diversity).
