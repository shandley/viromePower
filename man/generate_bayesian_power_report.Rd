\item{output_file}{File path for the output HTML report}

\item{title}{Title for the report (default: "Bayesian Virome Power Analysis Report")}

\description{
Creates an HTML report with visualizations and summaries of Bayesian power analysis results.
This report includes Bayesian-specific metrics like posterior probabilities and Bayes factors,
along with credible intervals and effect size distributions.
