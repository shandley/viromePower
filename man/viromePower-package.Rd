\title{Power Analysis for Virome Studies}
\description{
The viromePower package provides tools for statistical power analysis in virome studies.
It helps researchers design robust studies by estimating required sample sizes and
statistical power for detecting differences in viral abundances between groups,
accounting for the unique characteristics of virome data.
}
\details{
The package offers the following key functions:

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{simulate_virome_data}}: Generate simulated virome data with realistic characteristics.
  \item \code{\link{calc_virome_power}}: Calculate statistical power for a given sample size and effect size.
  \item \code{\link{estimate_sample_size}}: Estimate required sample size for a desired statistical power.
  \item \code{\link{plot_power_curve}}: Create visualizations of the relationship between sample size and power.
  \item \code{\link{generate_power_report}}: Generate comprehensive HTML reports with results and interpretations.
}

These functions account for specific virome characteristics including high sparsity,
low abundance, and high variability in viral metagenomic data.
