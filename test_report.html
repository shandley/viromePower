# Virome Study Power Analysis Report

## Study Overview

Number of viral taxa analyzed: 100
Expected effect size (fold change): 1.5
Statistical significance level (Î±): 0.05
Sparsity (proportion of zeros): 0.8
Statistical test method: wilcoxon

## Power Analysis Results

### Statistical Power

With 10 samples per group, the estimated statistical power is 0.6 .

This means there is a 60 % probability of detecting a true effect of the specified size.

### Sample Size Recommendation

To achieve 80 % power, we recommend a minimum of 24 samples per group.

## Distribution of Significant Features

At the recommended sample size, we expect to detect approximately 6 differentially abundant viral taxa.

## Assumptions and Limitations

- This analysis assumes a negative binomial distribution of viral counts
- Multiple testing correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method
- Power may be lower for extremely rare viral taxa
- Actual power depends on true biological variability
