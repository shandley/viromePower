# Introduction

Virome studies face unique challenges compared to general microbiome studies, including higher genetic diversity, extreme sparsity, and lower biomass. These factors make power analysis particularly important for virome research to ensure that studies have adequate statistical power to detect biologically meaningful differences.

The `viromePower` package provides tools to:

1. Estimate required sample sizes
2. Calculate statistical power
3. Simulate realistic virome data 
4. Generate comprehensive HTML reports

This vignette demonstrates the basic workflow for using `viromePower` to design robust virome studies.

# Basic Workflow

## 1. Estimating Sample Size

To determine how many samples you need for your study, use the `estimate_sample_size()` function:

```{r sample_size, eval=FALSE}
# Estimate sample size for 80% power to detect a 1.5-fold difference
# when testing 100 viral taxa
sample_size <- estimate_sample_size(
  power = 0.8,            # Target power
  effect_size = 1.5,      # Expected fold-change
  n_viruses = 100,        # Number of viral taxa
  alpha = 0.05,           # Significance level
  sparsity = 0.8,         # Proportion of zeros
  method = "wilcoxon"     # Statistical test
)

# View results
sample_size
```

## 2. Calculating Power

If you already have a fixed sample size (e.g., due to budget constraints), you can calculate the expected power:

```{r power, eval=FALSE}
# Calculate power for 15 samples per group
power_result <- calc_virome_power(
  n_samples = 15,         # Samples per group
  effect_size = 1.5,      # Expected fold-change
  n_viruses = 100,        # Number of viral taxa
  alpha = 0.05,           # Significance level
  sparsity = 0.8,         # Proportion of zeros
  method = "wilcoxon",    # Statistical test
  n_sim = 100             # Number of simulations
)

# View results
power_result
```

## 3. Visualizing Power Curves

To explore the relationship between sample size and power, use the `plot_power_curve()` function:

```{r curve, eval=FALSE}
# Plot power curve
power_curve <- plot_power_curve(
  effect_size = 1.5,                  # Expected fold-change
  n_viruses = 100,                    # Number of viral taxa
  sample_sizes = seq(5, 30, by = 5),  # Sample sizes to evaluate
  alpha = 0.05,                       # Significance level
  sparsity = 0.8,                     # Proportion of zeros
  method = "wilcoxon"                 # Statistical test
)

# Display plot
power_curve
```

## 4. Generating Comprehensive Reports

To create a detailed HTML report with interactive visualizations:

```{r report, eval=FALSE}
# Generate HTML report
report <- generate_power_report(
  power_results = power_result,
  sample_size_results = sample_size,
  power_curve = power_curve,
  output_file = "virome_power_report.html",
  title = "Virome Study Power Analysis Report",
  include_code = FALSE
)

# The report will be saved to the specified output file
```

# Advanced Usage

## Simulating Virome Data

You can simulate realistic virome data with the characteristics typical of viral metagenomic studies:

```{r simulate, eval=FALSE}
# Simulate virome data with 20 samples and 100 viral taxa
sim_data <- simulate_virome_data(
  n_samples = 20,      # Total number of samples
  n_viruses = 100,     # Number of viral taxa
  sparsity = 0.8,      # Proportion of zeros
  dispersion = 2,      # Dispersion parameter
  effect_size = 1.5    # Effect size for group differences
)

# The simulated data includes a count matrix and sample metadata
str(sim_data)
```

# Conclusion

The `viromePower` package provides a comprehensive suite of tools for designing statistically robust virome studies. By properly estimating required sample sizes and understanding statistical power, researchers can maximize the efficiency and reliability of their virome research.
